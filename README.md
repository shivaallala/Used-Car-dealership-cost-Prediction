# What Drives the price of a car

### Project Overview:

In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing information on 426,000 cars. The objective is to identify the key factors that influence the pricing of used cars. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a used car based on various features. Ultimately, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations to consumers on what aspects they should prioritize when purchasing a used car.

# CRISP-DM Framework:

We will follow the CRISP-DM framework, a widely-used process in the industry for data projects:

#### Business Understanding

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to identify factors influencing used car prices.
- Collect, clean, and prepare a large dataset of used cars for analysis.

#### Data Exploration

- Explore dataset features, determining their nature (categorical vs. numerical, discrete vs. continuous).
- Examine unique values to assess feature relevance and transformation needs.

#### Data Preparation

- Remove missing data, outliers, and duplicate records to ensure data quality.
- Perform necessary transformations, e.g., logarithmic transformation of the target variable.
- Finalize feature set and target variable for regression modeling.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets.

#### Regression Modeling

- Build pipeline for feature transformations and execute linear regression models.
- Compare RIDGE and LASSO linear regression models.
- Optimize regularization hyperparameters using grid search.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

#### Evaluation

- Conduct coefficient importance and residual analysis to assess model performance and feature significance.

#### Deployment

- Share key insights and business recommendations based on the analysis.
- Outline next steps for further refinement and improvement of the predictive model.

Our analysis aims to uncover insights into the factors driving used car prices, providing valuable guidance to consumers. We will highlight significant features and their impact on pricing, offering actionable recommendations for informed decision-making.
